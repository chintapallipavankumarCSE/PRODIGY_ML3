This project is focused on building a machine learning model to classify images of dogs and cats using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset contains a variety of labeled images, which are preprocessed through techniques like resizing and normalization to ensure consistency. The SVM model is then trained on these features to accurately distinguish between dog and cat images. The project showcases the effectiveness of SVM in handling binary classification tasks, particularly in the domain of image recognition, and evaluates model performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
